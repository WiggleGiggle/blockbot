## About Blockbot

Blockbot is a bot to help protect your server from people breaking the [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms).

Blockbot is the best solution to keep violators of Discord's rules out of your
community! Its goal is to provide a safe and reliable way to keep malicious
users away from you and your server.

## How The Bot Works

You can send reports to a bot moderator using `/report <report reason>`. A bot moderator will then read your report and decide if they will be blocked. When a "blocked" user joins a server with Blockbot it will ban them.

## Support

insert invite link here(because discord is blocked on my school computer)
